# Migo
Pre-Scan open ports for faster nmap scanning | Migo is only faster when running more intense parameters such as -sV or --script and so on... | 
<br/>
<br/>

## Installation

### Installation Requirements

Python3 and nmap
<br/>
<br/>

```
sudo apt install python3
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacobJohnson089/Migo/main/migo -o /usr/bin/migo
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/migo

```

<br/>
<br/>

## Usage
<br/>
you simply need to enter the Host-Client, Port-Ranges, and Nmap-Arguments,
 Then a nmap scan is gonna start on those ports who are open using the arguments you added -Pn is on by default as the ports are known to be alive
